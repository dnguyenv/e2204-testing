E2204: Testing for markup_styles_controller, lock_controller

Mentor: Nicholas Himes (nnhimes@ncsu.edu)

Description:

Refer to general testing guidelines above, but start by using the spec/controllers/lock_controller_spec.rb file and the test that has already been written as a jumping-off point.. View other controller specs for an idea of what your finished files should look like.
