E2207: Testing for submitted_content_controller
Mentor: Nicholas Himes (nnhimes@ncsu.edu)
Description:
Refer to general testing guidelines above, but start by using the spec/controllers/submitted_content_controller.spec.rb file and the test that has already been written as a jumping-off point.. View other controller specs for an idea of what your finished files should look like.
